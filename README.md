# Capstone-Project

The capstone assignment involved creating a programming project that would focus on data analytics, prediction and deplotment using python packages such as TkInter. I Conducted my capstone on prediction the price of mobile phones using a data set conatining values/elements that played a varible in the prediction aoutcome.

Tasks:
  - Reading a Dataset with Python.
  - Dataset Analysis and Prediction Studies.
  - Deployment of Predicter app using TkInter.
  - Presentation & Code Review Interview to display my comprehension of the task.

By navigating through dataset analysis, model selection, and effective presentation, I was able to showcase my ability to tackle real-world data science tasks with practical skills and critical thinking.
